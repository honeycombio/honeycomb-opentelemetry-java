## Example Apps

To use the examples:

- Add environment variables (or system properties)
- From the spring-agent or spring-sdk directory run `./gradlew bootRun`
- `curl localhost:8080` to get 'Greetings from Spring Boot!'

### spring-agent

This example uses the agent along with the SDK for enriching the auto-instrumented data.

### spring-sdk

This example uses the Honeycomb SDK for manual instrumentation.
